PlasmaCraft
===========

FluidizationCraft is a remake of the PlasmaCraft Mod from 1.7.10. In an attempt to keep it as the original, it adds the caustic fluids, but they're not as destructive as before. Many of the original items will be added by the final release along with a few extra features to allow for more depth. Recently it has been picked up again and is being updated to the new framework of Minecraft 1.20, along with additional updates.

Setup
===========

Just copy the .jar into the mods folder, and you're good to go, or you can download it directly from the CurseForge client as part of a custom ModPack
