PlasmaCraft
===========

FluidizationCraft is a remake of the PlasmaCraft Mod that hasn't had a release since 1.7.10. In an attempt to keep it as the original, it adds the caustic fluids, but they're not as destructive as before. Many of the original items will be added by the final release along with a few extra features to allow for more depth. As of now, with the new Minecraft 1.13 update, I won't be releasing much until after the new version of forge. I haven't run into any problems with the mod itself, but let me know with a PM if there are any issues.

Setup
===========

Just copy the .jar into the mods folder, and you're good to go.

Information
===========

I don't have a website right now or any other way to contact me except via PM's, and with any luck I can get this up and running shortly after the version of Forge for 1.13.
